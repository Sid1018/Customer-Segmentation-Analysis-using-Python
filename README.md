# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-using-Python


## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern marketing strategies. It allows businesses to tailor their marketing efforts to different groups of customers, resulting in more personalized and effective communication. This project aims to perform customer segmentation using various machine learning techniques in Python.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting the dataset containing customer information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the performance of machine learning models.
5. **Modeling**: Applying clustering algorithms to segment customers.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models and selecting the best one.
7. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results to better understand the customer segments.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sid1018/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-using-Python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-using-Python
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory (specify the path in the script if needed).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells to perform the analysis.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as age, income, spending score, etc. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and cleaned before using it in the analysis.

## Methodology

The following steps outline the methodology used in this project:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using various plots to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA.
4. **Clustering**: Applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering to segment customers.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the clustering algorithms using metrics like silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be presented in the notebook, including the optimal number of clusters, cluster centroids, and visualizations of the customer segments. Key insights and recommendations based on the segmentation will also be provided.
